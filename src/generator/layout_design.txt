Algorithm Layout Plan

I will have two layout definitions:

	1) Multi-Cluster Layout 
		- This layout will have clusters based on relationship data and stereotype.
			Closely related classes will end up clustered.
		- For instance, the printer part of a graph generator might be clustered with its components
			close together.
		- Each class will have a tinted box and label representing it's stereotype.
		- Each individual cluster will have a line crossing algorithm run on it
		- All clusters will act as a single node an the overall will have a LCM alg. run. 

	2) Three-Cluster Layout
		- This layout will have three areas
			- Boundary = contains classes that are interacted with
			- Control = contains classes used for control
			- Entity = contains classes that contain data or represent real-life objects
		- The different clusters will have boxes surounding them that will be tinted 
			different colors depending on the catagory
			- Boundary - Blue
			- Control - Red
			- Entity - Green 
		- Each individual cluster will have a line crossing algorithm run on it

Relationship Heirarchy
	1) Realization
	2) Generalization/Inhertiance
	3) Composition
	4) Aggregation
	5) Directed Association
	6) Association

	Multiplicity does not fall under the heirarchy as it doesn't affect the line or arrowhead.
